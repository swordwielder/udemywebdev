express middleware are functions that run during request/response life cycle

Middleware are just functions

Each middleware has access to the request and response objects

middleware can end the http request by sending back a respone with methods like res.send()

or middleware can be chained together one after another by calling next()

middleware functions can perform the follow:
*execute any code
*make changes to the request and the response objects
*end the request-response cycle
*call the next middleware function in the stack
