REST is an "architectural style for distributed hypermedia systes"

basically a set of guidelines for how a client
and server should communicate and perform CRUD
Operations on a given resource

The main idea of REST is treating data on the server side
as resources that can be CRUDed

The most common way of approaching REST is in formatting the URLs
and HTTP verbs in your applications.
